| Changed files vs upstream | `8` |

Changed files:

| File | Reason |
|---|---|
| `README.md` | Record Ergouzi fork and deployment relationship |
| `README_CN.md` | Record Ergouzi fork and deployment relationship |
| `src/features/authFiles/constants.ts` | Increase auth-file page-size limit to `100` |
| `src/pages/AuthFilesPage.tsx` | Add batch disable for current filtered auth-file results |
| `src/i18n/locales/en.json` | Add batch-disable labels |
| `src/i18n/locales/ru.json` | Add batch-disable labels |
| `src/i18n/locales/zh-CN.json` | Add batch-disable labels |
| `src/i18n/locales/zh-TW.json` | Add batch-disable labels |

Decisions created:

| Decision | Summary |
|---|---|
| `DEC-20260615-001` | Maintain CPAMC as an Ergouzi management-console fork |
| `DEC-20260615-002` | Publish `management.html` from the Ergouzi fork |
| `DEC-20260615-003` | Preserve filtered auth-file batch disable and page size `100` |

Verification already run for this baseline:

```bash
bun run type-check
bun run build
bun run lint
git diff --check
```

Known deploy requirement: create a `v*` release so this fork publishes
`management.html`; otherwise CLIProxyAPI cannot download the Ergouzi console
from GitHub latest release.
